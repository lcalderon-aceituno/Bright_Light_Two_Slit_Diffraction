# Two-slit Interference with Bright Light Analysis 

In this lab, the two-slit interference pattern created by bright light will be observed and analysied. Additionally, interference patterns for single-slit and two-slit scenarios will be measured and slit widths and the wavelength of light will be determined. Resulting data are recorded and graphed using Google Colaboratory.
